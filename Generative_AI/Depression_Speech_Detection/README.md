### Project Summary
This project explores fine tuning of the Qwen 2 Audio model for detecting depression through speech patterns, aiming to develop a more objective diagnostic tool compared to traditional self-reported assessments. We fine-tuned the model on the DAIC-WOZ dataset, comprising 189 patient interviews and over 9,000 processed audio samples.
