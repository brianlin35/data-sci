# Brian Lin's Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio! This repository showcases a diverse collection of projects spanning machine learning, data analysis, and artificial intelligence. Recently, I've been particularly focused on developing applications involving the use of new generative AI models, as the field continues to evolve at an exciting pace.

If there is one project to explore first, I highly recommend checking out the **Dress_Sense** project in the Generative AI section. It is my capstone project for the MIDS program at UC Berkeley, an AI-powered fashion recommendation system that represents the culmination of my recent work in generative AI and machine learning.
